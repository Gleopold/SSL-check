Input URLs: The script takes a list of URLs as input, which can be either provided as arguments or read from a configuration file. These URLs represent the websites or domains for which SSL certificate expiration dates need to be checked.

Web Scraping: Using urllib or requests, the script initiates connections to the specified URLs, sending HTTPS requests to retrieve SSL certificate information.

OpenSSL Integration: The script utilizes the OpenSSL library to parse and extract SSL certificate details from the remote servers. This includes information such as the certificate's validity period and expiration date.

Expiration Date Extraction: The script extracts the expiration date from the SSL certificate and formats it in a human-readable manner. It may also calculate the number of days remaining until expiration.

Output: The extracted SSL certificate expiration dates are presented as output, which can be displayed in the console or saved to a file for future reference or reporting.

Logging and Error Handling: The script includes robust error handling to account for various scenarios, such as unreachable websites, invalid URLs, or SSL certificate errors. It logs any errors or exceptions encountered during the process for troubleshooting and reporting.

Automation and Scheduling: Users can schedule this script to run periodically, ensuring that SSL certificate expiration dates are regularly checked, and proactive action can be taken to renew certificates before they expire.
